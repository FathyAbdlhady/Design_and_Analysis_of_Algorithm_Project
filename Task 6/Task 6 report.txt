Problem description:
There are six knights on a 3 Ã— 4 chessboard: the three white knights are at the bottom row, 
and the three black knights are at the top row.
Design an iterative improvement algorithm to exchange the knights to get the position shown on the right of the figure in the minimum number of knights moves, 
not allowing more than one knight on a square at any time.
