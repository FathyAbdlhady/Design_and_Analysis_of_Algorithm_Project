Problem description:
Is it possible for a chess knight to visit all the cells of an 8 × 8 chessboard exactly once, 
ending at a cell one knight’s move away from the starting cell? (Such a tour is called closed or re-entrant. Note that a cell is considered visited only when the knight lands on it, not just passes over it on its move.)
If it is possible design a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of moves the chess knight needs.
