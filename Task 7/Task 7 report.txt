Problem description:
A computer game has a shooter and a moving target. The shooter can hit any of n > 1 hiding spot located along a straight line in which the target can hide. 
The shooter can never see the target; all he knows is that the target moves to an adjacent hiding spot between every two consecutive shots. 
Design a Dynamic Programing algorithm that guarantees hitting the target.
